# VsCode Extensions

I use quite a list of extensions for VsCode, which tend to change over time.
The main extensions that I use will be the main focus of this file.
As of right now, I don't know of a way to install these extensions through the
command line, but once I do find a way, this README will be replaced with a
bash script to install them.

## Extensions List

- `Indent Rainbow` - This extension makes indentation more readable, especially
  when using Python.
- `rust-analyzer` - Is my tool of choice when working on a Rust project. It is
  the perfect tool for development in Rust.
- `shell-format` - Just a formatter for bash scripting, although it does
  provide formatting for other filetypes such as Docker files
- `ShellCheck` - I like to make sure that my bash scripts are done right, and
  this extension is a godsend.
- `Trailing Spaces` - An extension which highlights unnecessary white space,
  which something that I really like to avoid in files.
- `Code Spell Checker` - Just to make sure I don't make any typos.
- `GitLens` - For easy viewing of Git information.
- `Markdown All in One` - for Markdown previews and easy making of Markdown
  documents
- `Nix` - Language support for Nix in VsCode
- `YAML` - Language support for YAML in Vscode
- `Better Toml` - Language support for TOML in VsCode
- `vscode-pdf` - Easy viewing of pdf documents
